Things I want to do. User stories, even.

As a user I...
* want to log in to see private recipes and brew day plans
* want to be able to create a recipe
* want to see that recipe get partially populated as I go (est. water needs, ABV, Plato, ...)
* want to choose from a list of ingredients
* want to be able to add new ingredients
* want my added ingredients to be available elsewhere
* want to browse other's recipes
* want to plan a brew day using one or more recipes
* want my plans to include how much of each thing to buy as a shopping list
* want my recipes to be public or private or shared with other users

As a developer/admin I...
* want to use a private login setup
* want all recipes and ingredients to persist in a database
* want to use some canned sharing model
* want to serve as much as possible on the server side using something like Express.js
* want to view things on the front end using React.js
